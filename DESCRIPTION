Description: The `heckmange` package provides tools for the estimation of Heckman selection models with robust variance-covariance matrices. It includes functions for computing the bread and meat matrices, as well as clustered standard errors for generalized Heckman models. The package also offers cluster-robust inference with sandwich estimators, and tools for handling issues related to eigenvalues in covariance matrices.
