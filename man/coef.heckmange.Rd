\usage{
\method{coef}{heckmange}(
  object,
  part = c("selection", "outcome", "dispersion", "correlation"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{heckmange}, which contains the fitted model.}

\item{part}{A character vector indicating which parts of the model coefficients to return. Valid options are: "selection", "outcome", "dispersion", and "correlation". By default, all parts are included in the returned coefficients.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to or from other methods. These are not used in this method but must be included to match the generic method signature.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the coefficients extracted from the model object. The coefficients correspond to the specified model parts.
}
\description{
Extract Coefficients from a Generalized Heckman Model
}
\details{
This function extracts the coefficients from a \code{heckmange} class object. You can specify which parts of the model you want to retrieve the coefficients for: selection, outcome, dispersion, or correlation. By default, the function returns the complete coefficient vector for all parts.

The \code{coef.heckmange} function retrieves coefficients from the \code{heckmange} model object based on the specified parts. The parts represent different components of the Heckman model:
\itemize{
\item "selection": Coefficients related to the selection equation.
\item "outcome": Coefficients related to the outcome equation.
\item "dispersion": Coefficients related to the dispersion equation.
\item "correlation": Coefficients related to the correlation between selection and outcome.
}

The function collects the appropriate indices for the requested parts and returns the corresponding coefficients.
